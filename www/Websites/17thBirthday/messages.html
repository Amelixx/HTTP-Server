    <h3 class="msg">Dear Arun, it is so wonderful to hear that not only is it your 17th Birthday, but also, more
        importantly that you‚Äôre doing well! I‚Äôm very happy, proud and lucky to have you as a friend, I hope that on this
        day 17 years ago, although seemingly regular and ordinary, with nothing really out of place or special about
        today inherently, there is something special about it for you, and the family and friends who live and care for
        you. It is a day of celebration, a day to sing a particularly overused and tedious song, but it is important
        because of what the day represents, it represents your birthday, the 17 years later of your life, a life that I
        have been lucky to be apart of, even despite the fact I have never met you in person, I consider you a wonderful
        friend. Besides getting all soppy and emotional, I would like to wish you all the very best with your
        scholarship to the US, and furthermore your ongoing happiness. Oh, one more thing, know that you are loved, by
        many people in your life. Happy Birthday Arun, and for everything that is good in this world, shave that damn
        ‚Äúbeard‚Äù.</h3>

    <h3 class="msg">Hi rubix! Happy birthday! So when Greg first introduced you to me I thought ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs probably going
        to hate me because I‚Äôm dumb lmao‚Äù but you turned out to be a really cool person and I remember having a
        conversation about trees üòÇ. You‚Äôre a great person even though you steal my Greg! >:c and your YouTube channel
        is quality (because I‚Äôm on it!!!). Hope you have an amazing birthday and get everything you wanted! - Chl√≥e the
        washing machine :)</h3>
    <h1 class="msg-title">Hiraeth</h1>
    <h3 class="msg">Welp, yet again I'm sitting here procrastinating studying and doing some random thing on a
        pc... It might not seem like it but I do care a lot about you and Greg you're like the two annoying little
        brothers I never had, even tho you're older than me, in the end, all I wanna say is that without you and Greg i
        wouldn't be the same person I am today because you guys helped take my mind off of real-life shit that has
        happened in the past 2-3 years and I am grateful for all of what you've done, even tho It's indirect and
        unintentional, I know that deep down you care just as much as I do, Anyways as you know it's your brithday! This
        is like the second time, isn't it? I don't even remember what exactly I did last time but hey since this time
        happened within my short spanned memory I'm going to try to make it a good birthday for you and that's exactly
        why I asked your girlfriend for ideas for what to do for your birthday instead of coming up with my own as we
        all know you'd prefer whatever she says, Well to keep it brief spending these last years of my life with you has
        made them extremely stand out from the rest of my life you have influenced the person I am online so much that I
        genuinely think that I won't ever be able to forget you, on a sadder note I have had times where I was being
        insensitive to you and i apologize for that as it seems like that has influenced you pretty badly through how
        you act with me and others. But more importantly, this website is for you and hopefully, if I had actually
        finished this well I would have something else to give you that isn't much but should add to it generally, but
        seriously mate you've been really helpful to me throughout these past years and I genuinely think this
        friendship can last quite a while longer. Love you no homo.</h3>
